<h1>Sequencer Files</h1>
<p>A Sequencer file contains timed events for the <em>BasicSynth</em> sequencer.
This is a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; format that specifies each event with an absolute
start time in seconds, duration in seconds, and instrument parameters as
numeric values. Sequencer file format is tedious to enter manually, but
is a good format for external programs that generate events as output.</p>
<p>Each line in a sequencer file consists of a leading record type followed
by space delimited parameter fields.
Numbers (other than the <em>inum</em> field) may be entered as a real or integer value and may also 
include a leading negative sign (-). Character strings are enclosed in either single or 
double quote marks. The maximum length of any one field is 256 characters.
</p>
<p>Four note event types, and three control event types, can be specified in the file.</p>
<ul>
<li>START - begin a note at the time and duration indicated.</li>
<li>PARAM - modify a sounding note</li>
<li>STOP - stop a sounding note</li>
<li>RESTART - restart a sounding note</li>
<li>STARTTRACK - start a loop track</li>
<li>STOPTRACK - stop a loop track</li>
<li>CONTROL - MIDI controller change</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note Events</h3>
<p>The format of one note event line in the sequence file is as follows:</p>
<pre>[+|-|&]inum chnl time duration { param }</pre>
<p>
Lines without a leading +, - or &amp; will generate a START event.
A line beginning with + will generate a PARAM event. 
A line beginning with - will generate a STOP event. 
A line beginning with &amp; will generate a RESTART event. 
PARAM, STOP and RESTART event lines must follow the event that is to be modified 
with no intervening START events.
However, since the start time determines the ultimate sequence of events, 
the event will be applied based on the start time.
The duration of the initial note must be less than the delta time
to the PARAM, START or RESTART event. Otherwise the original note will no longer be playing and the event
will have no effect.
</p>
<p>
The first four fields are required. The <em>inum</em> field is an integer value that matches an 
entry in the instrument definition table. The <em>chnl</em> field indicates the output channel, 
usually a mixer input. The <em>time</em> and <em>duration</em> fields are numbers that specify the event 
time and duration in seconds.
</p>
<p>
The <em>params</em> are used to specify event information. For note events, the 
default parameter fields are as follows:
</p>
<table border="1" style="width:400;border-width:1">
<tr align="center"><td>Field</td><td>Position</td><td>Use</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pitch</td><td>4</td><td>The pitch class (0-127) with Middle C as 48.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frequency</td><td>5</td><td>Actual note frequency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Volume</td><td>6</td><td>Note volume normalized to [0,1].</td></tr>
<tr><td>Track</td><td>7</td><td>Sequencer track number (0 by default).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Velocity</td><td>8</td><td>Note on velocity.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Any following <em>params</em> are optional and specific to the instrument. 
Any number of <em>param</em> fields may be included, up to a maximum line length of 2048 characters.
By default, each parameter is passed to the event object using the parameter’s position 
on the line as the parameter identifier. In order to make parameters 
more flexible, the sequence file loader provides a parameter mapping function. 
A parameter map is a list of actual identifiers that should be passed to the event 
object along with the parameter index. A parameter map is a line beginning with an equal 
sign (=) followed by the instrument number and parameter ID numbers. The first
entry in the map corresponds to the first parameter (i.e., field number 4).
</p>
<pre>=inum id0 id1 id2…</pre>
<p>
This map would use <em>id0</em> as the identifier for the first parameter field,
<em>id1</em> for the second, etc. 
</p>
<p>
Typically, a note record will use either
pitch or frequency, but not both, and a map definition will be used to select
one or the other. For example, to set pitch and then volume, the map would
be:</p>
<pre>=1 4 6</pre>
<p>To use actual frequency followed by volume, the map would be:</p>
<pre>=1 5 6</pre>
<p>The builtin <em>Basicsynth</em> instruments have instrument specific
parameters starting at id value 16. For a complete list see <a href="instruments.html">
the instrument defintions</a> for each instrument.
</p>
<p>The following sequence will generate a C major scale using instrument 1 on mixer channel 0,
with a crescendo.</p>
<pre>
// Set first instrument parameter to pitch, second to volume
=1 4 6
1 0 0.00 0.25 48 0.72
1 0 0.25 0.25 50 0.76
1 0 0.50 0.25 52 0.80
1 0 0.75 0.25 53 0.84
1 0 1.00 0.25 55 0.88
1 0 1.25 0.25 57 0.92
1 0 1.50 0.25 59 0.96
1 0 1.75 0.50 60 1.00
</pre>

<h3>Control Events</h3>
<p>Control events have a leading @ character as the type with the following format:</p>
<pre>@type chnl time value1 value2</pre>
<p>The type field indicates the type of control event. Currently this must
be a valid MIDI status byte, with or without the channel number. For channel voice messages, 
the <em>chnl</em> value is automatically added to the control type value. For example,
to set the MIDI volume level to 100 on channel 0, use:</p>
<pre>@176 0 1.0 7 100</pre>
<p>
The value "176" is a controller change message, the value "7" is the volume controller,
and "100" is the volume level.
</p>
<h3>Track Events</h3>
<p>The <em>BasicSynth</em> sequencer has the capability to perform multiple background
loop tracks along with the main sequence. Any note placed on track 0 (the default) will
play when the sequencer is started. To set notes on background tracks, the track number must
be set to a value other than 0. </p>
<p>Loops are started by a loop start record and play a fixed number of times
or until a loop stop command is executed. A loop start command is indicated by
a &lt; character at the start of the line. A loop stop command is indicated by
a &gt; character at the start of the line.</p>
<pre>
&lt;time track count
&gt;time track
</pre>
<p>The <em>time</em> parameter sets the 
time when the loop starts. The <em>track</em> parameter indicates which track to play.
The <em>loop</em> parameter indicates the number of times to play the track.
If <em>loop</em> is set to 0, the track will continue to play until a stop track
command is executed.
</p>
<p>The following example creates two loops and then plays them. The first loop
is an C Maj arpeggio. The second is a G Maj arpeggio in first inversion.</p>
<pre>
// loop track 1 C
=1 4 6 7
1 1 0.000 0.125 48 0.50 1
1 1 0.125 0.125 52 0.50 1
1 1 0.250 0.125 55 0.50 1
1 1 0.375 0.125 52 0.50 1
// loop track 2 G6
1 1 0.000 0.125 47 0.50 2
1 1 0.125 0.125 50 0.50 2
1 1 0.250 0.125 55 0.50 2
1 1 0.375 0.125 50 0.50 2
// play loop 1 4 times
&lt;0.00 1 4
// play loop 2 4 times
&lt;2.0 2 4
// play loop 1 4 times
&lt;4.00 1 4
// play loop 2 continuously
&lt;6.00 2 0
// stop loop 2
&gt;10.00 2
